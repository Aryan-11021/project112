Snake Game This is a classic Snake Game made in Python using the Pygame library. The goal is to control the snake, eat the food (black block), and grow longer without hitting the walls or running into its own tail.

Scoring: Tracks and shows your current score. Game Over Screen: Option to play again or quit. Prerequisites You need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. This game requires the Pygame library, which you can install using pip: ```bash pip install pygame ``` How to Run Save the code: Save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., snake_game.py). Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.

Customization You can easily change game settings in the snake_game.py file: - dis_width and dis_height: Change the size of the game window. - snake_speed: Adjust this value to make the game faster or slower (default is 10). - Color Definitions: Change the colors of the snake, food, background, and text. For example, the snake's color is defined by the red variable.
